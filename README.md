# Customer-Info-Management

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

Simulate the realization of "Customer Information Management Software" based on the text interface.

The software can insert, modify and delete customer objects (implemented by array), and can print customer schedules


PURPOSE:

To test my understanding of Java language, knowledge of Oracle Object Programming and how to design a software application.


PROJECT REQUIREMENTS:

*Each customer's information is stored in the Customer object.

*Use an array of Customer type to record all current customers.

*After each "Add Customer" (Menu 1), the Customer object is added to the array.

*After each "Edit customer" (menu 2), the modified Customer object replaces the original object in the array.

*After each "delete customer" (menu 3), the Customer object is removed from the array.

*When executing "Customer List" (Menu 4), the information of all customers in the array will be listed.
